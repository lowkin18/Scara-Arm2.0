# Scara-Arm2.0

Created by Chris Kerluke

This scara robotic arm was designed to help me learn forward and inverse kinematics as well as some vision control feedback.

The Robotic Arm ended up working and was able to home itself based on vision feedback to within 1cm Accuracy

I did have problems with repeatability and accuracy of movements of the joints with the Hobby Servos

When I design a robotic arm in the future I will spend more time on picking actuators and designing the linkages between the components
to be more aesthetically pleasing.


CODE

In the code you will find the controls as well as the UART feed that talks with a QT OpenCV gui I developed.
